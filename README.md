## 💡 The Problem

Today, if you want to train an AI model, you have **one choice**: buy an NVIDIA GPU and use CUDA. One company controls the entire AI revolution. Students can't afford it. Startups can't compete. Developing nations are locked out.

**That ends now.**

</p>

## ⚡ The Solution: OjasX

**OjasX** is a PyTorch extension that makes AI run on **ANY GPU on Earth** — AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, ARM Mali, or NVIDIA — through the universal OpenCL standard.

```python
import torch
import torchcl  # ← This is OjasX

# Create tensors on ANY GPU (not just NVIDIA!)
x = torchcl.to_opencl(torch.randn(512, 512))
y = torchcl.to_opencl(torch.randn(512, 512))

# Matrix math on YOUR GPU
z = torchcl.matmul(x, y)
z = torchcl.relu(z)

# Train neural networks — no CUDA needed
result = torchcl.to_cpu(z)
```

> *"In Ayurveda, Ojas is the supreme energy that sustains life itself. OjasX channels that energy through silicon — giving the power of AI to every human being, on every chip."*

## 🏗️ Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.png" alt="OjasX Architecture" width="600"/>
</p>

OjasX is built as a layered engine. Each layer has a single responsibility:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    YOUR PYTHON CODE                     │
│              x = torchcl.matmul(a, b)                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    PUBLIC API (api.py)                  │
│         40+ operations: add, matmul, relu, softmax...   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                 COMPUTE ENGINE (engine.py)              │
│       Converts PyTorch tensors ↔ OpenCL GPU buffers     │
│              Launches kernels with optimal sizing       │
├──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┤
│   JIT COMPILER       │      KERNEL REGISTRY             │
│  Fuses multiple ops  │   Loads & caches compiled        │
│  into single kernels │   .cl kernel programs            │
├──────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┤
│              OPENCL RUNTIME (context.py + memory.py)    │
│    Platform discovery │ Buffer pool │ CPU↔GPU transfers │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                   ANY OPENCL DEVICE                     │
│        AMD │ Intel │ Qualcomm │ ARM │ NVIDIA │ FPGA     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How It Works — The 5 Layers

**Layer 1: Runtime Foundation** — Discovers your GPU, creates an OpenCL context and command queue, and manages a **caching buffer pool** that reuses GPU memory allocations for zero-overhead tensor creation.

**Layer 2: GPU Kernels** — Hand-written OpenCL C kernels optimized for each operation class:
- `elementwise.cl` — 16 kernels: arithmetic, math, comparisons
- `activation.cl` — 9 kernels with backward passes for autograd
- `matmul.cl` — Tiled matrix multiply using GPU local memory
- `reduction.cl` — Parallel tree reduction + softmax

**Layer 3: Compute Engine** — The bridge. Converts PyTorch tensors to OpenCL buffers, calculates optimal workgroup sizes, and launches kernels. This layer ensures **any** PyTorch operation maps to the correct GPU kernel.

**Layer 4: JIT Compiler** — The brain. Instead of launching 3 separate kernels for `relu(bias + matmul(A, B))`, it **fuses** them into a **single** GPU kernel at runtime. One launch instead of three = 3x less overhead.

**Layer 5: Auto-Tuner** — Queries your specific GPU (compute units, local memory, max workgroup) and selects **optimal** parameters. OjasX runs well on a $50 Intel integrated GPU AND a $10,000 data center GPU — it adapts automatically.

## 🧠 JIT Kernel Fusion — The Secret Weapon

Most AI frameworks launch **one GPU kernel per operation**. Three operations = three kernel launches = three rounds of overhead.

OjasX's JIT compiler **fuses** chains of operations into **one kernel**:

```
WITHOUT FUSION (3 kernel launches):
  GPU Launch 1: temp1 = A + B          ← overhead
  GPU Launch 2: temp2 = relu(temp1)    ← overhead
  GPU Launch 3: result = sigmoid(temp2)← overhead

WITH OJASX JIT (1 kernel launch):
  GPU Launch 1: result = sigmoid(relu(A + B))  ← ONE launch, ZERO overhead
```

The JIT compiler generates this fused OpenCL C code **at runtime**:

```c
__kernel void fused_binary_unary(__global const float* a,
                                 __global const float* b,
                                 __global float* output,
                                 const int n) {
    int gid = get_global_id(0);
    if (gid < n) {
        float a_val = a[gid];
        float b_val = b[gid];
        // sigmoid(relu(a + b)) — ALL in one kernel!
        output[gid] = (1.0f / (1.0f + exp(-(fmax((a_val + b_val), 0.0f)))));
    }
}
```

## 🌍 Vision & Mission

### Why This Matters

Today, 3 billion people own devices with GPUs that can run AI. But only those with NVIDIA cards can actually do it. That's not a technical limitation — it's a **business decision** by one company.

**OjasX changes this:**

- 🎓 **Students** in developing countries can train models on their Intel/AMD laptops
- 🏢 **Startups** can build AI products without $50K NVIDIA hardware budgets
- 🔬 **Researchers** can run experiments on whatever hardware their lab has
- 🌐 **Governments** can build sovereign AI infrastructure without vendor lock-in
- 🤖 **Edge devices** with ARM/Qualcomm chips can run local AI
  
  ### 🌱 For the Earth ###

AI has an energy crisis no one talks about. A single NVIDIA A100 GPU consumes **400 watts** — training one large model can emit as much CO₂ as **five cars in their entire lifetime**.

But here's what they don't tell you: most of that energy is wasted on hardware that was designed to render video game pixels, not multiply matrices. Meanwhile, chips built for efficiency already exist:

- **ARM Mali GPUs** consume **2-5 watts** — running in billions of phones worldwide
- **Intel Iris Xe** uses **15-25 watts** — already in your laptop
- **Qualcomm Adreno** draws **3-8 watts** — powers every Android flagship

These chips aren't as fast as a $40,000 NVIDIA H100. But they don't need to be. Not every AI task requires a nuclear reactor. A student training a model, a doctor running diagnostics, a farmer using crop analysis — they need **good enough** AI that runs on hardware that **doesn't burn the planet**.

OjasX makes this possible. By unlocking AI on energy-efficient silicon, we're not just breaking a monopoly — **we're reducing the carbon cost of intelligence itself**.

> *"The greenest GPU is the one already in your pocket."*


### The Roadmap

| Version | Milestone |
|:---:|:---|
| **V1** ✅ | Core engine: 40+ ops, JIT fusion, auto-tuner, MNIST training |

## ⚖️ License — The Shield of the People

> **This section is the most important part of this entire project.**

OjasX is released under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.

### What This Means

#### ✅ For the People (Students, Researchers, Indies, Startups)

**Use it. Modify it. Build on it. Ship products. Completely free. Forever.**

You can:
- Use OjasX in your research, your startup, your school project
- Modify the source code however you want
- Distribute your modifications
- Use it commercially in your own products

**One simple rule:** If you modify OjasX and distribute your version (or run it as a cloud service), you must release your modifications under the same AGPL-3.0 license. This ensures your improvements flow back to humanity.

#### 🛡️ Against Monopolists

The AGPL-3.0 is a **"copyleft" or "viral" license**. Here's what that means for companies who want to lock this technology away:

> **If a corporation takes OjasX, modifies it, and uses it to build a proprietary product or cloud service — they are LEGALLY REQUIRED to publish ALL of their modifications as open source under the same license.**

This makes it **mathematically impossible** to build a secret monopoly on top of this technology. The license acts as an unbreakable shield that keeps the fire of compute in the hands of the public **forever**.

The AGPL specifically closes the "cloud loophole" that exists in the regular GPL — so companies can't hide modified code behind SaaS servers.

#### 💼 Commercial Licensing (Dual License)

If your company wants to use OjasX **without** open-sourcing your proprietary code, a **commercial license** is available. Contact: [mkrishna.16july@gmail.com](mailto:mkrishna.16july@gmail.com) and [mohanakrishnanannuru@gmail.com]
This dual-licensing model ensures:
1. **The technology stays free** for individuals and the open-source community
2. **Corporations must contribute back** if they use the free version
3. **Companies who want privacy** can pay for it — funding further development

> *"The technology belongs to everyone. If you want to keep secrets, pay the toll."*
